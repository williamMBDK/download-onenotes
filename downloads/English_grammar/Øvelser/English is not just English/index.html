			<p style="margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt">English, being a lingua franca, does not only exist in one version. As a matter of fact, the English language has developed throughout the years, and this has resulted in dialects commencing. For example, the British accent consists of different dialects spread out in the UK. These dialects especially diversifies through pronunciation, but also the choice of words (the vocabulary) makes dialects vary. Dialects can even emerge in the same local areas. This can be observed in larger cities, though sociolects and ethnolects are also very typical types of language variation in these cities, for example in London. A dialect is just one of many ways languages develop, but in the English language specifically, this type of variation is common, since English is typically spoken in bigger countries.</p>
